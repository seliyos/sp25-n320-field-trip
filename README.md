## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

For this project, I chose to focus on **Native American woven baskets**. These handcrafted artifacts were made by Indigenous communities in North America and are rich in cultural and historical significance. They were used for practical purposes like storage and food gathering, but they also served ceremonial and artistic roles. I chose these baskets because their designs are intricate, symbolic, and they reflect the deep connection between art, nature, and tradition. And also growing up, when I travel to country side to my grand mother, I remeber serving us food with hand woven plates whch looked similar. This topic also fits perfectly with the theme of combining art, history, and technology.

### Core Webpages

- **Home Page**: Introduces the artifact and provides a brief historical background on Native American basket weaving.
- **Gallery Page**: Features an interactive image gallery of the baskets, where users can click on each one to learn more about its origin, patterns, and use.
- **Design Breakdown Page**: Uses animations to highlight different parts of the basket (colors, weave style, pattern) and explains their meaning.
- **Interactive Weave Simulator**: A mini web app where users can try a simplified digital weaving experience to understand the process.
- **Quiz/Game Page**: Includes a short interactive quiz or matching game about basket patterns and their cultural meanings.

### Design Choices

- **Inspiration**: The visual design of the website will be inspired by earthy, natural colors and textures from Native American art.
- Iâ€™m referencing museum sites like the https://americanindian.si.edu/
- **Color Palette**:
  - Earth brown: background
  - Clay red and muted orange: for highlights and interactive buttons
  - Tan and cream: used for clean readability and contrast
- **Data Structure**: I will use a JavaScript array of objects to store data about each basket. Each object will include properties like `title`, `tribe`, `region`, `patternMeaning`, and `imageURL`. This structure will help dynamically generate content on the gallery and info pages.
